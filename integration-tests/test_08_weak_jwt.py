Test Weak JWT Secret Vulnerability (API2:2023 Broken Authentication)

This test demonstrates weak JWT secret key vulnerability. The application uses
'random' as the JWT secret key, which is easily guessable and allows attackers to:
1. Decode and read JWT payloads
2. Forge valid JWT tokens for any user
3. Bypass authentication entirely
