Test Lack of Rate Limiting Vulnerability (API4:2023 Unrestricted Resource Consumption)

This test demonstrates the absence of rate limiting on all API endpoints.
Without rate limiting, attackers can:
1. Perform brute-force attacks on authentication
2. Enumerate users and resources
3. Launch denial-of-service attacks
4. Scrape all data from the API

OWASP Reference: https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa4-unrestricted-resource-consumption/
